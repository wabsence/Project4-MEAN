# MEAN STACK IMPLEMENTATION

#### In this project, we dive into the approach of deploying a MEAN stack solution, it is most likely similar to the MERN implementation approach just that in this case, instead of using REACT to power the frontend, ANGULARJS is being used.

#### Also, the project require students to modify the route.js file thats serves as the API for all end points, so that users will be able to View, Add and Delete a record (Book). This is achieved through the modification of the callback function using asynchronous code i.e asyn/wait command of the javascript.

#### Also, students are now familiar with Security Group for their EC2 instances in aws and of what impact it has on their application. For this project, a port 3300 is to be added to the inbound rule.

#### In this project, we developed a Book Register Application to help keep track of books, the authors, isbn, and number of pages 

#### In summary, This project is based on the techniques involved to successfully deploy a MEAN stack software solution.

#### it inculdes tasks such as:

* Backend Configuration (NodeJS and MongoDB Installation)
* ExpressJS Installation
* Models
* API.
* MongoDB Database
* AngulaJS
